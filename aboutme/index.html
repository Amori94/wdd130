    <p>I am married to my wife Deby, and recently have become proud father to twin girls. 
        They were born just a week ago, so still getting used 
        to being called a "father".
    </p>
    <p>I am very excited to learn more about web development. I have been goofying
        around with simple html pages since I was a teen.
