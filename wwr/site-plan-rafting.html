    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The website is needed so that people searching for us online will be able to find us and know what the company is about. Once the website is 
      up, people will be able to find and contact us as well as make online reservations for our services. This will help our companay grow by finding
      new customers, as well as giving a better service to current customers.

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>We are targeting people who like to travel and like rafting. This could be families, as well as young adults who are looking for a nice holiday or weekend.
      They will need to know which services we offer, and when they are available, as well as prices. Probably the
      reason why they will be looking for our website is because they are not being able to find a place to go practice rafting.
      Most people will find our site with a mobile device.
