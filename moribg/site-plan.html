      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I would like to make a website that can show video tutorials that I have uploaded to Youtube, 
        aswell as adding more depth to my videos by having images and text like step by step guides. 
        Also, I would have links to useful sites related to the tutorials, an about me page, and a 
        gallery showing my work. I make home made boardgames, so this site would be about that.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Board game geeks like myself, and any other hand craftman that wants to enter the world of boardgames</p>  <!-- change this -->

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This website is created as a landing page for people who have found my youtube tutorials. This page will help them find more info on my tutorials as well as written down tutorials with their respective images to follow along, step by step. It will also have info on what I am currently working on as well as news on future upcoming videos. For people don't know my work on youtube, they will be able to find every link needed, as well as info on who I am and what I do.
Some of the answers that the users will get are, who I am, what I do, what I am currently working on and updates on my future videos. People will also be able to find step by step guides with text and images, in case the videos aren’t that clear for them. The home page will help to give a general idea as to those first answers, and the secondary pages will have tutorials and boardgames I am working on, or currently playing, along with reviews.
Some of the things that visitor will be able to do is follow along on tutorials, download PDF’s of boardgames I have already edited, download guides, manuals of games. Also, they will be able to read reviews on boardgames, and decide between buying one or another.
To accomplish these actions, I will need to add info about me, some of my reviews and all the content I already have of my tutorials.
The reason why visitors will go to my site instead of another site will probably to have access to the content I have on printing board games.
The Home page should give you access to the tutorials page and the boardgames review page. It will have a banner showing my latest tutorial, followed by a “news” section, that will have info on what I am currently working on, like games I will be reviewing, or tutorials I am currently making. After this section, there will be a direct link to two tutorials (like the most watched, or something like that) and a section to a direct link to a review (most visited review for example). At the bottom there will be a “about me” section, that will explain a little of what I do and who I am. The footer should have links to my Instagram.

      </ul>
      <h3>Tutorials</h3>
      <p>
        The first secondary page based on the tutorials will have a list of links to go to each tutorial. This page will have a brief explanation of each tutorial, as well as some other general information. Each tutorial page will have the video on youtube, if there is one, and below that a step-by-step guide, with images to follow along. These pages will also have some downloadable content, and links to other pages that gave me some ideas, this way, anything I learned from someone else is accessible to the visitors, and I also give credit to the correct content creator.

      </ul>
      <h3>Boardgames</h3>
      <p>
        The other secondary page will have information on general boardgames. The idea is to have reviews on each of these games. It will have links to buy them, as well as links to their publisher website. It will have images on the game’s parts, like tokens, boards, cards, etc. It will explain how the game is played, going over the base mechanics, how they are used in the game, and the how to win, or what the objective of the game is. After this brief overview of the game, I will give my opinion on that game, what I think works great and what it could probably do better, if there is anything.
